# HederaAir System Architecture

## Overview
HederaAir is a decentralized property booking platform built on the Hedera network. The system architecture is designed to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience for property rentals using blockchain technology.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend Layer
The frontend is built using Next.js, providing a modern and responsive user interface.

#### Components:
- **Next.js Framework**
  - **Serverside**: Handles server-side rendering and API routes
  - **Client**: Manages client-side interactions and state management

- **HashConnect Integration**
  - Provides wallet connection and authentication
  - Enables secure transaction signing
  - Manages user session and wallet state

### 2. Backend Services Layer
The backend consists of several microservices that handle different aspects of the application.

#### Services:
- **NFT Service**
  - Manages property NFT creation and minting
  - Handles property metadata and availability
  - Controls NFT transfers and ownership verification

- **Payment and Escrow Management Service**
  - Processes booking payments
  - Manages escrow contracts for property rentals
  - Handles payment disputes and refunds

- **Account Service**
  - Manages user profiles and authentication
  - Handles account creation and updates
  - Stores user preferences and history

- **MirrorNode Service**
  - Queries the Hedera network state
  - Provides transaction history and status
  - Monitors network events and updates

### 3. Hedera SDK Integration Layer
This layer provides direct interaction with the Hedera network through various SDK services.

#### Components:
- **HTS (Hedera Token Service)**
  - Creates and manages NFTs
  - Handles token transfers and associations
  - Manages token properties and metadata

- **HSCS (Hedera Smart Contract Service)**
  - Deploys and executes smart contracts
  - Manages contract state and interactions
  - Handles contract upgrades and maintenance

- **HCS (Hedera Consensus Service)**
  - Provides consensus timestamps
  - Manages message ordering and validation
  - Ensures network synchronization

### 4. Hedera Network Layer
The foundation layer that provides the blockchain infrastructure.

#### Features:
- High throughput transaction processing
- Fast finality
- Secure consensus mechanism
- Environmental sustainability
- Enterprise-grade security

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction Flow**
   ```
   User → HashPack Wallet → HashConnect → Frontend → Backend Services → Hedera Network
   ```

2. **Property Listing Flow**
   ```
   Owner → NFT Service → HTS → Hedera Network
   ```

3. **Booking Flow**
   ```
   Guest → Payment Service → Escrow Contract → HTS → Hedera Network
   ```

## Security Features

1. **Wallet Integration**
   - Secure key management through HashPack
   - Transaction signing at the client side
   - No private key exposure to the backend

2. **Smart Contract Security**
   - Automated testing and verification
   - Access control mechanisms
   - Secure fund management through escrow

3. **Network Security**
   - Hedera's native security features
   - Consensus-based validation
   - Immutable transaction records

## Technical Implementation Details

### Smart Contracts
- NFT Contract: Manages property tokens and availability
- Escrow Contract: Handles booking payments and disputes
- Access Control: Manages permissions and roles

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// Example HashConnect Integration
const hashConnect = new HashConnect(true);
await hashConnect.init({
    networkType: "testnet",
    metaData: {
        name: "HederaAir",
        description: "Decentralized Property Booking",
        icon: "icon-url"
    }
});
```

### Backend Services
```typescript
// Example NFT Service Integration
class NFTService {
    async createProperty(metadata: PropertyMetadata): Promise<TokenId> {
        // Create NFT token
        // Set availability
        // Return token ID
    }

    async bookProperty(tokenId: TokenId, dates: DateRange): Promise<BookingId> {
        // Check availability
        // Create booking
        // Handle payment
    }
}
```
